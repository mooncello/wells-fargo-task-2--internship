# Wells Fargo Software Engineering Work Simulation Project

This repository contains my two tasks from the Wells Fargo Software Engineering Virtual Work Simulation Project on the Forage online application. I took on the role and adopted skills of a project analyst, where my primary responsibility was to design a data model for a new system that helps financial advisors manage their clients' portfolios more efficiently. The two main tasks were to: 
    1. Data Model and Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) Design: I drafted a comprehensive ERD that satisfies the project requirements and helps guide the development team in creating a well-structured system. I learned how ERDs are essential for designing relational databases. 
    2. Implementing the Data Model with Java: In the second task, I translated the data model into Java classes within Visual Code Studio. I created classes for each entity, annotated them with @Entity, ensured auto-generation of primary keys, added constructors to initialize instance variables, and provided getter and setter methods for the attributes. 

## Skills Acquired
    1. Entity Modeling
    2. Java Development: OOP (Encapsulation, Classes, Abstraction) 
    3. Git: Cloning repositories, committing changes, and pushing code to GitHub
